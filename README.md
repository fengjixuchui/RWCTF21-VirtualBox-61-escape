## How does it work?

We wrote a blogpost describing the vulnerabilities and our exploit techniques. You can find it [here](https://secret.club/2021/01/14/vbox-escape.html).

I had the pleasure of working with this group of talented people over the course of multiple sleepless nights and days during and even after the CTF was already over just to get the exploit working properly on a release build of VirtualBox and to improve stability. This truly shows what a small group of dedicated people is able to achieve in an incredibly short period of time if they put their minds to it! I'd like to thank every single one of you :D
